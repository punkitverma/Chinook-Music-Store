-- Q1. Does any table have missing values or duplicates? If yes how would you handle it ?

WHERE fax is NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer -- 49 company, 29 state, 47 fax values are null in the customer table
WHERE fax is NULL;
SELECT * from employee; -- 1 reports_to value is null in the employee table
SELECT * FROM genre;
SELECT * FROM invoice;
SELECT * FROM invoice_line;
SELECT * FROM media_type;
SELECT * FROM playlist;
SELECT * FROM playlist_track;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM track -- 978 composer columns are null in the track table
WHERE composer is NULL

/*
The dataset does not contain any duplicate values, ensuring data accuracy and reliability.
To handle null values, the COALESCE function would be used.
